== Introduction ==

This open source library aims to help the implementation of JSON-RPC clients in android applications.

== Getting started ==
The library provides the class JSONRPCClient to perform JSON-RPC method calls on remote services.

{{{
JSONRPCClient client = JSONRPCClient.create("http://service/uri");

try 
{
  String string = client.callString("mymethod");
  double d = client.callDouble("pow", x, y);
  int i = client.callInt("add", 56, 25); ...
}
catch (JSONRPCException e)
{
  e.printStackTrace();
}
}}}

Currently the library supports only JSON-RPC call over HTTP.
Support for TCP/IP would be interesting for creating efficient web services
